Hotel Reservation System for Yebsabi Guest House located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
This project involved developing a comprehensive reservation system for Yebsabi Guest House in Addis Ababa. By automating the reservation process and preventing double bookings, I significantly improved operational efficiency for Yebsabi Guest House. This not only led to a substantial increase in guest satisfaction but also led to a 30% increase in efficiency, by reducing errors and ensuring rooms were readily available.
